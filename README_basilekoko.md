# The Airport challenge:

My approach to solve this challenge is to create 3 different classes to
handle different aspects of the user story requirements:

1. Airport class that will handle the decision to allow a plane to land
   or take off according to the weather or the status of the airport
(i.e full or empty)

2. Plane class which is reponsible of implementing the planes landing
   and taking off

3. Weather class, which will generate the current weather state randomly
   as per the challenge requirement
